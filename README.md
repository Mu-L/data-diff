## Get started

### Installation

#### First, install `data-diff` using `pip`.

```pip install data-diff```

**Note:** Once you've installed Python 3.7+, it's most likely that `pip` and `pip3` can be used interchangeably.

#### Then, install one or more driver(s) specific to the database(s) you want to connect to.

- `pip install 'data-diff[postgresql]'`

- `pip install 'data-diff[snowflake]'`

- TODO We support 10+ other databases. Check out [TODO link to documentation] for specifics.

### Run your first diff

Once you've installed `data-diff`, you can run it from the command line:

`data-diff DB1_URI TABLE1_NAME DB2_URI TABLE2_NAME [OPTIONS]`

[TODO here's one example of code that you can copy and paste, just like from the screenshot]

Check out the [Documentation TODO add link](#) for all the options and database-specific configurations.
